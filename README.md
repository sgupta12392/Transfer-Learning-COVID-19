# CMSC-678-ML-Project

Implemented a Deep Neural Net model for Detection of COVID-19 in Pneumonia-affected Patients Using Chest X-Ray Images. Built the model using Transfer Learning by fine-tuning pre-trained models available in FastAI based on PyTorch like VGG16 and ResNet50 that have been pre-trained on ImageNet dataset.
